# Example Games

Hopefully these example games might be useful to anyone trying to figure this library out. Each is a self contained leiningen project including all the resources needed to run.

Feel free to use any of these as a skeleton for whatever you're doing, there's a good chance you'll want a mish-mash of several examples.

# Running

You can run an example from the command line:

``` bash
lein run
```

But often it's more useful to start a repl and invoke the `-main` function directly:

``` Clojure
(basic-sprite.core/-main)
```
